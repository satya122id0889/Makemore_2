# Makemore_2

I conducted an in-depth exploration of PyTorch to enhance the efficiency and performance of specific operations within a neural network architecture. Leveraging these optimizations, I developed a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model that surpassed previous iterations in terms of loss reduction. The generated outputs exhibited a marked improvement, demonstrating a more human-like quality compared to random character sequences observed in earlier models.

To gain deeper insights into the model's behavior, Matplotlib was employed to visualize embeddings, loss curves, and other relevant metrics. This visualization process proved instrumental in understanding the model's strengths and weaknesses.

Overall, this endeavor provided valuable insights into the intricacies of neural networks and the potential of PyTorch for accelerating model development and optimization.
